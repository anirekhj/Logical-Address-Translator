# Logical-Address-Translator
A C program that translates a series of logic addresses into the corresponding physical addresses for paging-based computers.

 For simplicity, we assume that the computer under investigation is byte addressable. 
 Namely, each byte has a unique address.In addition, the size of logical memory is 16 bytes, 
 the size of page/frame is 4 bytes, and the size of physical memory is 32 bytes. Consequently, 
 there are 4 pages and 8 frames. And there are 4 entries in the page table.
